## Description
The package contains a shader used for billboarded terrain details with waving and bending support and components to provide the required bend data to the shader.

## How to use
Paint grass on the terrain. Make sure the grass is billboarded (it will use a default shader otherwise).

Add a `BendGrassWhenEnabled` or `BendGrassWhenVisible` component to a gameobject that should apply the bend effect when positioned over the grass.

`BendRadius` controls the radius of the bending sphere with center being the pivot of the gameobject. 

`Priority` is used to control the bending source priority; when concurrent bend sources limit is exceeded, benders with lower priority values will be served first.

You can also add your own implementation of the `IGrassBender` interface instead of using the built-in bender components.

The bending grass shader replaces Unity's default `Hidden/TerrainEngine/Details/BillboardWavingDoublePass` shader used for the terrain grass when `Billboard` option is enabled. It additionally allows to control the wind waving and bending power via the healthy/dry color tint alpha; when alpha of the both colors is zero, the wind and bending won't affect the grass at all.
